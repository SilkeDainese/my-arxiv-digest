I built this during my PhD in astronomy at Aarhus University to stay on top of new papers without doomscrolling arXiv. Others found it useful, so I made it public — it works for anyone whose papers are on arXiv.

---

## Quick Start
1. **[Open the config page →](https://arxiv-digest-production-93ba.up.railway.app)** — it walks you through everything, including secrets. Download `config.yaml` when done.
2. **[Fork this repo →](https://github.com/SilkeDainese/arxiv-digest/fork)** and upload `config.yaml` to the repo root.
3. Add the <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-for-github-actions/security-guides/using-secrets-in-github-actions" title="Secrets are GitHub's way of storing passwords and access codes safely — only your repo can see them, they stay hidden from everyone else">secrets</a> the config page told you to add.
4. Run it: <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/understanding-github-actions" title="Actions is GitHub's built-in automation — it runs your digest on a schedule, like a timer you set once and forget">Actions</a> → enable workflows → `arXiv Digest` → `Run workflow`

> **That's it.** *Runs automatically Mon/Wed/Fri at 9am Danish time.*

<summary><sub>🎓 Students — there's an easier setup for you</sub></summary>

On the config page, choose the `student mini-setup`. You get pre-built interest packages (exoplanets, stars, galaxies, cosmology) with sensible defaults and a lighter weekly schedule. You can customise it later.

From another field? [Write me](mailto:dainese@phys.au.dk) and I'll set up packages for your speciality.

<details>
<summary>Something not working?</summary>

- Make sure workflows are enabled — `Actions` tab → click "I understand my workflows, go ahead and enable them"
- Secrets go in *your fork*, not the original repo
- The file must be named exactly `config.yaml` (not `config (1).yaml`) and sit in the repo root
- First run: use `Run workflow` manually to test — check the log if no email arrives
- Outlook users: set `smtp_server: "smtp.office365.com"` in `config.yaml`
- Adding secrets manually: `Settings` → `Secrets and variables` → `Actions` → `New repository secret`
  - `RECIPIENT_EMAIL` — your email address
  - `DIGEST_RELAY_TOKEN` — the token from the config page
  - No invite code? Use `SMTP_USER` + `SMTP_PASSWORD` instead ([Gmail App Password →](https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords))

## FAQ

### Setup

<details>
<summary>I'm a student — is there an easier way?</summary>

Yes! See the [student setup](#-students--theres-an-easier-setup-for-you) at the top of this page.

</details>

<details>
<summary>What if I don't have an invite code?</summary>

You can send digests from your own email instead. Add these secrets instead of the relay token:

- `SMTP_USER` — your email address
- `SMTP_PASSWORD` — an app password ([Gmail →](https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords))

Outlook users: also set `smtp_server: "smtp.office365.com"` in [`config.yaml`](config.example.yaml).

</details>

<details>
<summary>Do I need an API key?</summary>

No. An API key is like a password that lets your digest talk to an AI service (Google or Anthropic) to rank papers more intelligently. Keyword scoring works fine without one. If you want smarter ranking later, get a free key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey) or [Anthropic Console](https://console.anthropic.com/) and add it as a repo secret.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Can I use the terminal to set up instead?</summary>

Run `python -m scripts.friend_setup` from a checkout of this repo. It opens the config page, waits for the file in Downloads, forks the repo, uploads the config, and enables Actions.

</details>

### How it works

Keywords + optional AI re-ranking + collaborator boost. Details:

<details>
<summary>How does scoring work?</summary>

You describe your research in `config.yaml` — keywords, field, a free-text description of your work, and optionally your collaborators. The digest scores every new arXiv paper in three steps:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A["📄 Your interests"] --> B["📡 arXiv API"]
    B --> C["🔑 Keyword match"]
    C --> D["🤖 AI re-ranking"]
    D --> E["👥 Author boost"]
    E --> F["📧 Digest"]
```

1. Keyword matching — your keywords vs. each paper's title and abstract, weighted 1–10. Fuzzy: `planet` matches `planetary`.
2. AI re-ranking — reads your free-text research description and re-ranks by *actual relevance*, not just term overlap. The more specific your description, the better.
3. Author boost — papers by your collaborators get bumped. Papers you authored get a celebration section.

If AI is unavailable, the system cascades automatically:

| Tier | Provider | What happens |
|------|----------|--------------|
| 1 | Claude (Anthropic) | Used if you add `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` |
| 2 | Gemini (Google) | Used if you add `GEMINI_API_KEY` |
| 3 | Keywords only | Always works — no key needed |

If one tier fails, the next takes over. You always get a digest.

</details>

<details>
<summary>How does the feedback loop work?</summary>

When you click ↑ or ↓ on a paper card in your digest email, it creates a GitHub issue in your fork. The next run reads those issues automatically — upvoted keywords get a scoring boost, downvoted ones get dampened. The system learns what you care about over time.

To enable feedback arrows, set `github_repo: "yourusername/arxiv-digest"` in [`config.yaml`](config.example.yaml).

</details>

### Using your digest

<details>
<summary>Can I change the schedule?</summary>

Yes — edit the cron line in [`.github/workflows/digest.yml`](.github/workflows/digest.yml). The default is Mon/Wed/Fri at 9am Danish time.

</details>

<details>
<summary>How do I pause or unsubscribe?</summary>

- Pause: go to your repo → `Actions` → `arXiv Digest` → click `⋯` → `Disable workflow`
- Delete: go to your repo → `Settings` → scroll to Danger Zone → `Delete this repository`

Every digest email also includes self-service links at the bottom (edit interests, pause, re-run setup, delete).

</details>

<details>
<summary>What can I customise?</summary>

See [`config.example.yaml`](config.example.yaml) for all options with inline comments. Key fields:

| Field | What it does |
|-------|-------------|
| `research_context` | Free-text description of your research — the more specific, the better |
| `keywords` | `keyword: weight` pairs (1–10) |
| `categories` | arXiv categories to monitor (e.g. `astro-ph.EP`) |
| `research_authors` | Authors whose papers get a relevance boost |
| `colleagues` | People/institutions whose papers always show |
| `digest_mode` | `highlights` (fewer, better) or `in_depth` (wider net) |
| `recipient_view_mode` | `deep_read` (full cards) or `5_min_skim` (top 3 one-liners) |
| `self_match` | Your name as it appears on arXiv — triggers a celebration when you publish |

</details>

<details>
<summary>Can I run it locally?</summary>

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python digest.py --preview        # renders in browser, no email
python digest.py                  # full run (needs RECIPIENT_EMAIL + email secrets)
python setup/server.py            # run the config page locally (localhost:8080)
```
