"""Fail-closed quality gate for the Monday student send.

Silke's directive: "rather no send than send."

Every paper in the pending digest must have a non-empty plain_summary AND
a non-empty highlight_phrase before any student email goes out. If any paper
fails either check, the entire send is aborted and Silke receives a failure
notification. No partial sends. No fallback to raw abstract.

Additional checks (v2):
  - plain_summary must not start with any banned author-voice opener
  - plain_summary must be at least 40 characters

Additional checks (v3 — Sprint 1 Fix 3):
  - AI-scored papers (score_tier == "ai") must have ai_score >= 3.0
  - Keyword-only papers must have subscriber_score > 0
